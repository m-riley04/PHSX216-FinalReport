# Final Report: PHSX 216 - Physics 1 Laboratory
Author: Riley Meyerkorth
## Class Information
* Class: PHSX 216 - Physics 1 Laboratory
* TA: Stephen Schan
## Functionality
Allows the user to predict the needed angle for a projectile launcher when given a specific target. 

## Classes
### Application
Driver class for the program.
### Launcher
Comes with 4 methods:
- predict(target)
- low(distance)
- medium(distance)
- high(distance)

## Equipment Information
### Launcher
The projectile launcher that is being used is from the University of Kansas physics department for PHSX 216 Physics I Laboratory. It's exact name is the ___________. The angle of the launch is measured from 0 degrees to 90 degrees directly on the launcher's body itself.

The launcher also has 3 modes: low, medium, and high. The power of the launch is determined by these modes.

### Projectile
The projectile that the launcher is using is a yellow 10 gram hollow plastic sphere that came with the kit. A metal 67g sphere is also provided which may provide more accurate short-distance results, and implementation of such may be added in the future.
